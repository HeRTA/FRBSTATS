## FRBSTATS: Visualizing FRB Parameters Online

Accessible via a user-friendly web interface, **FRBSTATS** includes an open-access catalogue of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) published up to date, along with a statistical overview of the observed events. In addition to the ability of obtaining FRB data directly through the FRBSTATS API, the platform supports the plotting of parameter distributions for a variety of visualizations.

FRBSTATS is a fully **open-source** platform. Anyone is welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/HeRTA/FRBSTATS/issues) with code, data and ideas for improvement.
